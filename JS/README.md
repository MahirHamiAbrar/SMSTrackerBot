# SMSTrackerBot
#### JS Version for Easier Remote Hosting

### Run the bot
To run the bot, open terminal and type this:
```bash
node main.js
```
This will launch the bot. But make sure to put `credentials.json` and `ai-bot-credentials.json` files in the `credentials` directory.

To obtain the `credentials.json` file for Google sheets service-account, See the official quickstart guide.

You will also need telegram bot access token (find BotFather Telegram-Bot and send '/newbot' message and then follow the instructions), and Groq API key. All these credentials are stored in the `ai-bot-credentials.json`. A dummy template is available in the `credentials` directory.
