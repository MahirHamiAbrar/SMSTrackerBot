# SMSTrackerBot
#### JS Version for Easier Remote Hosting

### Run the bot
To run the bot, open terminal and type this:
```bash
node main.js
```
This will launch the bot. But make sure to put `credentials.json` and `ai-bot-credentials.json` files in the `credentials` directory.

To obtain the `credentials.json` file for Google sheets service-account, See the official quickstart guide.

You will also need telegram bot access token (use BotFather Telegram Bot to get it), and Groq API key. All these credentials are stored in the `ai-bot-credentials.json`. A dummy template is available in the `credentials` directory.
